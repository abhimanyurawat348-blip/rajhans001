# Quiz System Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the updates made to the quiz system for CBSE Class 9 and Class 10 students, including the addition of new questions and implementation of random question selection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Question Database Update
- **Class 9 Mathematics**: Added 10 new CBSE objective-type questions
- **Class 9 Science**: Added 10 new CBSE objective-type questions
- **Class 9 Social Science**: Added 10 new CBSE objective-type questions
- **Class 10 Mathematics**: Added 10 new CBSE objective-type questions
- **Class 10 Science**: Added 10 new CBSE objective-type questions
- **Class 10 Social Science**: Added 10 new CBSE objective-type questions

Each subject now has a total of 20 questions (10 original + 10 new).

### 2. Random Question Selection
Implemented a random selection algorithm that chooses 10 questions from the 20 available questions for each quiz session. This ensures:
- Variety in quizzes across multiple attempts
- Reduced memorization of question positions
- Better assessment of student knowledge

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Question Selection Algorithm
```typescript
const getRandomQuestions = (questions: QuizQuestion[], count: number): QuizQuestion[] => {
  // Shuffle array using Fisher-Yates algorithm
  const shuffled = [...questions].sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
  // Return first 'count' items
  return shuffled.slice(0, count);
};
```

#### Integration with Quiz System
- Modified `QuizPlay.tsx` to use the random selection function
- Updated the quiz initialization to select 10 random questions
- Maintained all existing quiz functionality (timer, scoring, etc.)

### 4. Question Categories

#### CBSE Class 9 Mathematics
- Polynomials and algebra
- Geometry and angles
- Arithmetic and percentages
- Probability and statistics

#### CBSE Class 9 Science
