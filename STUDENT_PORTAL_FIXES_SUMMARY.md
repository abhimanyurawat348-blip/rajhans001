# Student Portal Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Username Display Issue
**Problem**: StudentHome.tsx was displaying `studentData?.username` but during signup, users were providing full names, not usernames.

**Solution**: 
- Updated StudentSignup.tsx to collect `fullName` instead of `username`
- Updated StudentHome.tsx to display `studentData?.fullName || studentData?.username || 'Student'` for backward compatibility
- Modified all references to use `fullName` as the primary field

### 2. Missing Student Information
**Problem**: Fields like class, section, and admissionNumber were being displayed but weren't collected properly during signup.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced StudentSignup.tsx form to collect all necessary student information:
  - Full Name
  - Admission Number
  - Class (3-12)
  - Section (A-D)
  - Date of Birth
  - Father's Name
  - Mother's Name
  - Email
  - Password
- Added proper validation for all fields
- Improved UI/UX with better form organization

### 3. Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Code expected student data in the users collection, but marks were in a subcollection under students collection, creating inconsistency.

**Solution**:
- Created utility functions in `src/utils/studentDataUtils.ts` for consistent data handling
- Implemented dual storage approach:
  - Primary storage in `users` collection (by UID)
  - Secondary storage in `students` collection (by admission number)
- Added fallback mechanisms for data retrieval
- Created `syncStudentData()` function to ensure consistency between collections

### 4. Hardcoded/Missing Data
**Problem**: Student profile information wasn't being collected or stored properly during registration.

**Solution**:
- Comprehensive form in StudentSignup.tsx collects all student information
- Proper storage in Firestore with consistent structure
- Added profile editing feature with StudentProfileEditModal.tsx
- Implemented data synchronization between collections

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `src/components/StudentProfileEditModal.tsx` - Modal for editing student profile
2. `src/utils/studentDataUtils.ts` - Utility functions for consistent data handling

### Modified Files:
1. `src/pages/StudentSignup.tsx` - Enhanced signup form with complete student information collection
2. `src/pages/StudentHome.tsx` - Improved data fetching and display with profile editing integration

## Key Features Implemented
