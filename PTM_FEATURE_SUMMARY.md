- Identifies range formats (containing "-")
- Expands ranges into individual numbers
- Handles both padded (001) and non-padded (1) admission numbers

### Zoho Meeting Integration
- Simulated meeting link generation with unique identifiers
- Proper time zone handling for Indian Standard Time
- Secure storage of meeting links in Firestore

### Security & Access Control
- Parents can only access PTMs assigned to their children
- Staff have full read/write access to all PTM data
- Meeting links are protected and only accessible to invited participants

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Dedicated PTM section in Staff Portal with intuitive form
- Attractive meeting cards in Parent Portal with join buttons
- Prominent Dronacharya AI status message in Home Dashboard
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes

## Testing & Verification

All functionality has been tested and verified:
- PTM creation, editing, and deletion in Staff Portal
- Roll number range parsing (1-10) and comma-separated (1,2,3) formats
- Parent access control and security rules
- Time zone conversion to IST
- UI responsiveness and visual design

## Integration Points

### Firestore Collections
1. **`ptm_schedule`**: Primary collection for PTM data with fields for date, time, participants, and meeting links
2. **`users`**: Cross-referenced to map students to their parents for access control
