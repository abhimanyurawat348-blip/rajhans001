- Clear naming conventions and folder structure

### Scalability
- Component-based architecture allows for easy feature additions
- Firebase integration provides scalable backend services
- Modular design enables team collaboration
- TypeScript ensures code quality and maintainability

### Documentation
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Component prop interfaces clearly defined
- Function purposes documented
- Complex logic explained with comments

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully delivers all features outlined in the CEO's directive, transforming the RHPS EdTech Web Portal into a modern, AI-powered learning ecosystem. The modular approach ensures maintainability and scalability for future enhancements.
