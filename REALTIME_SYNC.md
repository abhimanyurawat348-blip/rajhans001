# Real-time Data Synchronization

## Overview
The school management system implements real-time data synchronization across all portals (Student, Parent, and Staff) to ensure consistent and up-to-date information.

## Technologies Used
- **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time database with live synchronization
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user authentication
- **React Hooks**: useEffect for setting up listeners
- **Cloud Functions**: (Future implementation) Server-side logic

## Implementation Details

### Real-time Listeners
The system uses Firestore's `onSnapshot` method to create real-time listeners for critical data:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.id) {
    // Set up real-time listener for homework
    const homeworkQuery = query(
      collection(db, 'homework'),
      where('studentId', '==', user.id)
    );
    
    const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(homeworkQuery, (snapshot) => {
      const homeworkData = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data()
      }));
      setHomework(homeworkData);
    });
    
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }
}, [user?.id]);
```

### Synchronized Data Collections
The following collections are synchronized in real-time:
- **Homework**: Updates appear instantly across Student, Parent, and Staff portals
- **Marks**: Grade updates are immediately visible to students and parents
- **Attendance**: Daily attendance records sync across all portals
- **Notifications**: Staff notifications for new logins, registrations, and complaints

### Performance Considerations
- Listeners are properly unsubscribed when components unmount
- Queries are optimized with appropriate indexes
- Data is filtered client-side to reduce unnecessary updates

## Security
- All data transmission is encrypted
- Access controls ensure users only see relevant data
- Authentication tokens are validated for each request

## Future Enhancements
- Implement WebSocket fallback for better offline support
- Add conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Include data compression for large datasets
