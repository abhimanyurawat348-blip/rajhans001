# Quiz Navigation Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of navigation controls for the quiz system, allowing students to move between questions and review their answers before submitting.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Bidirectional Navigation
- **Previous Button**: Allows students to go back to the previous question
- **Next Button**: Allows students to move to the next question
- **Finish Button**: Appears on the last question to submit the quiz

### 2. Answer Persistence
- Answers are saved for each question as students navigate
- Students can change their answers when returning to previous questions
- All answers are preserved until quiz submission

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Disabled "Previous" button on the first question
- Clear visual indication of the current question position
- Progress bar showing overall completion status

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedAnswers, setSelectedAnswers] = useState<number[]>([]); // Store all answers
```
- Changed from single `selectedAnswer` to array `selectedAnswers` to store answers for all questions
- Initialized with null values for each question

### Navigation Functions
```typescript
const handlePrevious = () => {
  if (currentQuestionIndex > 0) {
    setCurrentQuestionIndex(currentQuestionIndex - 1);
  }
};

const handleNext = () => {
  if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length - 1) {
    setCurrentQuestionIndex(currentQuestionIndex + 1);
  }
};
```

### Answer Selection
```typescript
const handleAnswerSelect = (answerIndex: number) => {
  const newSelectedAnswers = [...selectedAnswers];
  newSelectedAnswers[currentQuestionIndex] = answerIndex;
  setSelectedAnswers(newSelectedAnswers);
};
```

### UI Components
- Added Previous/Next buttons with appropriate icons
- Disabled Previous button on first question
- Changed Finish button to only appear on last question
- Maintained consistent styling with existing UI

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Flexibility
- Students can review and change answers at any time
- No pressure to answer questions in sequence
- Ability to skip difficult questions and return later

### 2. Clarity
- Clear visual indication of current position
- Disabled buttons when navigation is not possible
- Consistent progress tracking

### 3. Error Reduction
- Students can correct mistakes without penalty
- No accidental quiz submission
- Clear path to completion
